/* Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third 
and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership 
of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. 
Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. 
Write functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists. */
